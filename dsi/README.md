# Fisch's Diags for NITRO / TWL
Basic system test suite for Nintendo DS, DS Lite and DSi.
Uses some code from godmode9i, NTM, or WordleDS. Thank you to Epicpkmn11, Robz, and everyone/anyone working on DS(i) stuff and posting publicly for reference. 

also I see I have tiny-json in the source dir, I completely forget what I wanted to use that for tbh.


typical side note;
Uhhh two versions exist, homebrew version provided here and an even better version rewritten with the offical TwlSDK. Being that the TwlSDK is "leaked content" from Nintendo, I don't really wanna get a letter from them for posting source of an application that requires leaked content... yada yada... Nintendo pls just push a branched sdk that you can consider "safe" for homebrew consumption. nitro-character was an absolute blast to work with, the whole SDK is awesome. CTR SDK is the bane of my existence at the moment but I'll save that ramble for later.
